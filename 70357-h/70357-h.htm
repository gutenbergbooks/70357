  <p>In studying the history and the effect of the contact of the
    Southwestern Indians with civilization, the writer was baffled by
    what appeared to be the sudden and almost complete disappearance of
    a populous tribe which played a rather prominent part in the history
    of the early exploration and colonization of the Southwest, which
    occupied villages of a more or less permanent character, and among whom
    missionaries labored in fruitless endeavor to show them the way to
    Christianity. It is not usually difficult to account for the decimation
    or even for the extinction of a tribe ravaged by war or by epidemics,
    of which there are numerous instances; but of the Jumano Indians, of
    whom this paper treats, there is no evidence that they were especially
    warlike in character, that they had a greater number of enemies than
    the average tribe, or that they had suffered unusually the inroads of
    disease.</p>

  <p>The Jumano were first visited by Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and his
    three companions of the ill-fated Narvaez expedition, while making
    their marvelous journey across Texas and Chihuahua in 1535. The name
    of the tribe is not given by them: they are called merely the “Cow
    Nation”; but the relation of an expedition nearly half a century
    later makes it evident that no other people could have been meant.
    The narration of Cabeza de Vaca is so indefinite that from it alone
    it would be difficult even to locate the place where the Jumano were
    found; but the testimony, meager though it be, tends to indicate that
    in 1535, as in 1582, they lived on the Rio Grande about the junction
    of the Rio Conchos and northward in the present state of Chihuahua,
    Mexico.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

  <p>The first Jumano seen by Cabeza de Vaca was a woman, a captive among
    an unknown tribe, members of which were guiding the forlorn Spaniards
    across the desolate and broken country toward the west in southwestern
    Texas. Reaching the Rio Grande, Castillo and the negro Estevanico,
    who had journeyed ahead, came to a town at which the captive woman’s
    father lived, “and these habitations were the first seen, having the
    appearance and structure of houses.” The inhabitants subsisted on beans
    and squashes, and the Spaniards also had seen maize. Besides food, the
    natives gave the white men buffalo-robes—seemingly the first of their
    sort mentioned in history. The Indians came in numbers and took the
    Spaniards “to the settled habitations of others, who lived upon the
    same food.” It may, I think, be assumed that these other habitations
    were those of other Jumano, although Cabeza de Vaca mentions that from
    the second settlement of houses onward was another usage. “Those who
    knew of our approach,” he says, “did not come out to receive us on
    the road as the others had done, but we found them in their houses,
    and they had made others for our reception. They were all seated with
    their faces turned to the wall, their heads down, the hair brought
    before their eyes, and their property placed in a heap in the middle
    of the house. From this place they began to give us many blankets of
    skin; and they had nothing they did not bestow. They have the finest
    persons of any people we saw,” he continues, “of the greatest activity
    and strength, who best understood us and intelligently answered our
    inquiries. We called them the Cow Nation, because most of the cattle
    [buffalo] killed are slaughtered in their neighborhood,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and along up
    that river for more than fifty leagues they destroy great numbers.”</p>

  <p>The narrator continues: “They go entirely naked after the manner of
    the first we saw.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The women are dressed with deer-skin, and some
    few men, mostly the aged, who are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>incapable of fighting. The country
    is very populous. We asked how it was they did not plant maize. They
    answered it was that they might not lose what they should put in the
    ground; that the rains had failed for two years in succession, and the
    seasons were so dry the seed had everywhere been taken by the moles,
    and they could not venture to plant again until after water had fallen
    copiously. They begged us to tell the sky to rain, and to pray for it,
    and we said we would do so.”</p>

  <p>Seeking information regarding their route westward, the Spaniards were
    told that “the path was along up by that river [the Rio Grande] towards
    the north, for otherwise in a journey of seventeen days we could find
    nothing to eat, except a fruit they call <i>chacan</i>, that is ground
    between stones, and even then it could with difficulty be eaten for its
    dryness and pungency,—which was true. They showed it to us there, and
    we could not eat it. They informed us also that, whilst we traveled by
    the river upward, we should all the way pass through a people that were
    their enemies, who spoke their tongue, and, though they had nothing
    to give us to eat, they would receive us with the best good will, and
    present us with mantles of cotton, hides, and other articles of their
    wealth.... Their method of cooking is so new that for its strangeness
    I desire to speak of it; thus it may be seen and remarked how curious
    and diversified are the contrivances and ingenuity of the human family.
    Not having discovered the use of pipkins, to boil what they would eat,
    they fill the half of a large calabash with water, and throw on the
    fire many stones of such as are most convenient and readily take the
    heat. When hot, they are taken up with tongs of sticks and dropped into
    the calabash until the water in it boils from the fervor of the stones.
    Then whatever is to be cooked is put in, and until it is done they
    continue taking out cooled stones and throwing in hot ones. Thus they
    boil their food.”</p>

  <p>We dwell thus at length on Cabeza de Vaca’s account, as it is the first
    reference to the Jumano in history, and because it affords the earliest
    information as to what manner of people they were. There are few Indian
    tribes, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> history forms part of that of our own land, that have a
    record traceable to the first half of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>The next Spaniards to pass through the Jumano country were Francisco
    Sanchez Chamuscado and his party in company with three missionaries, in
    1581; but no new light is thrown on the tribe in question, and indeed
    there is no definite evidence in the account of two of the soldiers<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
    who were members of the little party that they were seen at all,
    although the Rio Grande was followed northward from its junction with
    the Conchos.</p>

  <p>Much more definite information, however, is afforded by the next
    Spaniards to traverse their territory, led by Antonio de Espejo,
    who, in November, 1582, set out from San Bartolomé, in Chihuahua,
    and followed the bank of the Rio Grande northward from the mouth of
    the Conchos. From about the junction onward for twelve days’ journey
    Espejo was among these people, who, he says, occupied five villages
    with an aggregate population of ten thousand—perhaps four-fold the
    actual number, as Espejo’s estimates are always greatly exaggerated.
    The Jumano did not at first receive the strangers with the same
    friendliness as was shown Cabeza de Vaca and his companions, although
    it might be said that the latter met with a reception, owing to the
    magic power that they were supposed to possess and the awe inspired
    by it, such as perhaps has never been experienced by white men since
    their time. Espejo gives a rather definite account of the Indians under
    discussion, who, it will be observed, occupied the valley of the Rio
    Grande from the Conchos northward almost to the boundary of the present
    New Mexico. He says they were called Jumanos, and by the Spaniards
    Patarabueyes. Some of their houses were terraced, while others were
    of straw. The faces of the Indians were striated, evidently meaning
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>tattooed, as the sequel will show. They cultivated maize, calabashes,
    and beans; hunted animals and birds, and especially the buffalo, and
    caught fish of many kinds in the two streams that united within their
    territory. They had lakes within their domain, from which they obtained
    salt during certain seasons as good as that from the sea. Of special
    importance in the identification of the people met by Cabeza de Vaca,
    Espejo states that three Christians and a negro had passed through the
    Jumano country years before, in whom he naturally recognized “Alvaro
    Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, y Dorantes, y Castillo Maldonado, y un negro,”
    who, as is well known, finally reached Culiacan and the City of Mexico
    after trials and suffering almost beyond belief.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>Juan de Oñate, colonizer of New Mexico and founder of Santa Fé, passed
    over Espejo’s route for a part of his journey through Chihuahua to the
    new province, but instead of traversing the Conchos to its junction
    with the Rio Grande, he made a more northerly course to the crossing
    of the latter stream at the present El Paso, consequently leaving the
    country of the Jumano on his right.</p>

  <p>Whether the Jumano had entirely shifted their habitat between 1582 and
    1598 is not definitely known, but it seems probable that they had not.
    Espejo had returned to Mexico by way of the Rio Pecos, leaving it for
    the Conchos some 120 leagues below Pecos pueblo, hence missing the
    Jumano territory of eastern New Mexico which later became known. And,
    as we have seen, Oñate did not follow a course in the journey northward
    with his colonists that would have enabled him to see the Jumano of the
    Conchos-Rio Grande junction.</p>

  <p>But we have definite knowledge that the Jumano lived in the present
    New Mexico at least as early as the time of Oñate, i. e. in 1598, for
    on October 6 of that year he departed with the father commissary “to
    the salinas of the Pecos, which are of many leagues of indefinite
    salt, very beautiful and white; and to the pueblos of the Xumases or
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>Rayados, which are three: one very large, and they saw the others.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>There were in reality four instead of three important villages of the
    Jumano in New Mexico at the close of the sixteenth century, their
    names, according to Oñate, being Atripuy, Genobey, Quelotetrey, and
    Pataotrey.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> These, with many villages of the Pueblo Indians from
    Pecos southward through the country known as the Salinas, were placed
    under the ministration of Fray Francisco de San Miguel; but there is no
    evidence that the friar visited all of them, and it is quite certain
    that no churches were built in this immediate region at so early a
    date.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>The <i>Salinas</i> referred to are situated in the central portion of
    that part of Valencia county, New Mexico, lying east of the Rio Grande.
    Bounding the salt lagoon area on the south is the Mesa de los Jumanos,
    or, as it is termed on present-day if not altogether “modern” maps,
    “Mesa Jumanes.” This land-mark of course derived its name from the
    tribe which formerly occupied the vicinity, a fact illustrating the
    persistency with which aboriginal names are sometimes retained in the
    Southwest, even where good excuse may exist for forgetting them.</p>

  <p>The Salinas country, although known far and wide for its generally
    inhospitable and forbidding character, was inhabited at the opening
    of the seventeenth century and for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>twenty-five years later, by the
    eastern divisions of the Tigua and Piro (the latter sometimes being
    known as Tompiro), as well as by the Jumano. The former two groups
    belong to the Tanoan linguistic family and inhabited several pueblos
    similar to those of their Rio Grande congeners. When, in 1626, Fray
    Alonso Benavides, the Father Custodian of the missions of New Mexico,
    appealed for additional missionaries, he had particularly in mind the
    conversion of the tribes of the Salinas region, especially the Jumano,
    among whom Fray Juan de Salas had already been. Says Benavides, writing
    in 1630, “I kept putting off the Xumanas who were asking for him
    [Salas], until God should send more laborers.”</p>

  <p>Through their affection for Salas, the founder of the mission of
    Isleta, the Jumano went year after year for some six years prior to
    1629 to visit him at that Rio Grande mission station in the hope, they
    asserted, that he might come to live among them. Finally, on July 22,
    1629,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a delegation of some fifty Jumano visited the pueblo of San
    Antonio de Isleta, where the custodian (probably Estevan de Perea) was
    then staying, for the purpose of again asking for friars; and “being
    questioned as to what induced them to make this demand, they said that
    a woman wearing the habit had urged them to come; and being shown a
    picture of Mother Luisa de Carrion, they rejoiced, and speaking to
    each other said that the lady who had sent them resembled the picture,
    except that she was younger and more beautiful.” Fray Juan de Salas
    and Fray Diego Lopez volunteered to go, accompanied by an escort of
    three soldiers. They found the Jumano this time more than 112 leagues
    (about 300 miles) to the eastward from Santa Fé, or possibly in the
    western part of the present Kansas in the vicinity of what later became
    known as El Quartelejo. The cause of this shifting may have been due
    to the hostility among the tribes of the Salinas about this time, of
    which Benavides speaks, for subsequent history seems to indicate that
    the Jumano were never an aggressive people. Not to enter into detail
    regarding the miracles which Salas and his companion are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>said to have
    performed among the Jumano on the plains, some 30 or 40 leagues west of
    the “Quiviras” (who are identified with the Wichita tribe of Kansas),
    it may be said that the missionaries found 2,000 of these Indians,
    who, with many others from neighboring tribes (Benavides says there
    were 10,000 in all), clamored loudly for baptism, while two hundred
    lame, blind, and halt rose up well “when the sign of the cross was made
    and the words of the Gospel pronounced over them.” Indeed, they were
    inspired “with so great devotion to the cross that they fell on their
    knees before every cross and adored it, and in their houses,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> over
    their doors, they put crosses.”</p>

  <p>After remaining some days, the fathers departed for the valley of
    the Rio Grande; and it would seem that the Jumano soon followed,
    for, according to Vetancurt, “owing to the continual invasions, and
    wars with their enemies the Apaches, this conversion could not lead
    to a permanent result in that place, and hence they removed to the
    Christians near Quarac,” whence they were ministered.</p>

  <p>There has been much discussion regarding the location of the “pueblo”
    occupied by the Jumano that was dedicated to “the glorious Isidoro.”
    We may assume that it was not until after the visit of Salas to the
    Jumano on the plains in July–August, 1629, that this mission was
    founded, since the new friars did not arrive from Mexico until Easter
    of that year, and prior to that time no permanent missionaries were
    available even had the Jumano not been three hundred miles away on the
    prairies. We learn from the <cite>Relacion</cite> of Fray Estevan Perea,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
    the successor of Benavides as custodian of the missions of New Mexico,
    and under whose guidance the new missionaries came in the spring of
    1629, that there were sent to the pueblos of the Salinas—“in the great
    pueblo of the Xumanas, and in those called Pyros and Tompiras”—six
    priests and two lay religious, one of whom, Francisco de Letrado, is
    known to have been assigned to the Jumano alone. It does not seem
    necessary to look for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>the “great pueblo of the Xumanos” of which
    Benavides speaks, among the ruins of eastern New Mexico, from amongst
    the débris of which the massive walls of former Spanish churches and
    monasteries still rise, for it is scarcely likely that the Jumano
    occupied a village other than their own, or that the settlement was
    anything but an aggregation of dwellings of the more or less temporary
    kind which they were found to occupy when visited by Cabeza de Vaca and
    by Espejo on the lower Rio Grande.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>That active missionary work was conducted by Letrado among the Jumano
    is certain. We have seen that this friar was assigned to the tribe soon
    after his arrival in New Mexico as a member of Perea’s band in the
    spring of 1629; but three years later we find him at Zuñi on his way to
    convert the savage and little-known “Cipias,” although he was murdered
    by the Zuñi before he reached them, on February 22, 1632—a century to
    the day before the birth of Washington.</p>

  <p>Why missionary work among the Jumano was thus apparently abandoned,
    there is no definite knowledge, but it would seem to have been due
    to another shifting of the tribe from New Mexico to the plains, and
    another change from their erstwhile sedentary life to that of buffalo
    hunters. There is a suggestion of this, indeed, in an account written
    by Fray Alonso de Posadas,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> who states that Fray Juan de <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>Salas and
    Fray Juan (Diego?) de Ortega, with an escort, visited the Jumano on a
    stream which they called Rio Nueces, and Ortega remained among them for
    six months. From this account the Rio Nueces might have been almost
    anywhere in the country of the plains, and not necessarily the present
    Rio Nueces of Texas.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The important point, however, is the fact
    that Letrado had abandoned his station among the Jumano in eastern New
    Mexico in 1632, and that in the same year Salas went forth again on the
    plains apparently for the purpose of bringing them back.</p>

  <p>The history of New Mexico between Benavides’ time and the great Pueblo
    rebellion of 1680 is meager indeed, consequently of the shiftings of
    the Jumano, if any there were during that period, little is known.
    In 1650 they were evidently still on the plains, for, according to
    Posadas, Captain Hernan Martin and Diego de Castillo in that year went
    with some soldiers and Christian Indians 200 leagues from Santa Fé to
    the “Rio Nueces” where the Jumano were again found. They remained in
    the region more than six months, going southeastward down the river
    for 50 leagues, visiting the Cuitoas, Escanjaques, and Aijaos, and
    finally the Tejas. During their journey the party traversed, from north
    to south, a distance of 250 leagues, or, according to Posadas, from
    the latitude of Santa Fé in 37° to that of the Tejas in 28°. It should
    here be noted that the Escanjaques have always been identified with
    the Kansas or Kaw Indians, and such may be the case. The Cuitoas, the
    Tejas (Texas or Hasinai), and the Aijaos, however, were Texan tribes,
    and indeed the last, as later will be seen, are identifiable with
    no other than the Tawehash, the name of the southern branch of the
    Wichita, sometimes applied to the entire Wichita group, as well as to
    the Wichita proper. This point should be borne in mind, as the Jumano
    and the Aijaos are here mentioned as if two distinct tribes.</p>

  <p>In 1654 another journey was made to the Jumano on the Rio Nueces by
    Lieutenant-Colonel Diego de Guadalajara, with 30 soldiers and 200
    Christian Indians. The Cuitoas, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>Escanjaques, and Aijaos were this
    time at war. Captain Andres Lopez, of the party, with twelve soldiers,
    together with some of the Christian Indians and Jumano, were sent
    forward, finding a rancheria of Cuitoas, 30 leagues eastward, whom they
    severely defeated.</p>

  <p>These facts are mentioned for the purpose of showing that the Jumano,
    at least, although friendly toward the Spaniards, had apparently not
    occupied eastern New Mexico for some twenty-two years prior to 1654,
    but that they were living on the plains and leading their customary
    semi-sedentary life.</p>

  <p>As previously stated, Fray Juan de Salas, earlier in the century,
    found the Jumano on the prairies about 112 leagues eastward from the
    Rio Grande. But distances given by the early Spanish travelers must be
    regarded as only approximate, and there is no reason for believing that
    the tribe had moved farther away simply because Captains Martin and
    Castillo, in 1650, are said to have found the Jumano on the Nueces 200
    leagues from Santa Fé. They may have been in practically the same spot
    during this quarter century.</p>

  <p>There is ground for strong suspicion that the village or villages of
    the Jumano on the plains at this time were in proximity to if not
    actually at the Quartelejo, or Cuartelejo, mentioned frequently by
    writers of the 18th century. The distance of the Jumano from Santa Fé,
    according to two writers above cited, varied from 112 to 200 leagues
    (300 to 530 miles); while El Quartelejo, according to the record,
    was from 130 to 160 leagues (350 to 425 miles) from the New Mexican
    capital.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This Indian outpost was situated in the valley of Beaver
    creek, in northern Scott county, Kansas, as has been shown by Williston
    and Martin.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p>El Quartelejo first appears in history about the middle of the
    seventeenth century, when “some families of Christian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>Indians of the
    pueblo and tribe of Taos uprose, withdrew to the plains of Cibola
    [i. e. the buffalo plains], and fortified themselves in a place
    which afterward was for this reason called the Cuartelejo. And they
    were in it until Don Juan de Archuleta [in 1652?], by order of the
    Governor, went with 20 soldiers and a party of auxiliary Indians and
    brought them back to their pueblo. He found in the possession of these
    revolted Taos, casques and other pieces of copper and tin; and when
    he asked them whence they had acquired these, they replied ‘from the
    Quivira pueblos,’ to which they had journeyed from the Cuartelejo....
    From Cuartelejo in that direction one goes to the Pananas [Pawnees];
    and to-day it is seen with certainty that there are no other pueblos
    besides the said [Panana] ones, with which the French were by then
    already trading. Besides this in all the pueblos which the English and
    French have discovered, from the Jumano to the north or northeast, we
    do not know any to have been found of the advancement and riches which
    used to be imagined of the Gran Quivira.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <p>It has been seen that the Jumano were still on the plains in 1654, and
    that their former settlement in the Salinas of New Mexico had evidently
    long been abandoned. It is said that, in 1670, “many Indians from the
    Pueblo of the Jumanos were at El Paso, but the roads to the [former]
    Jumano country [the Salinas] were closed by the Apaches,”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> whose
    depredations soon became so serious that between the years 1669 and
    1675 every settlement of the Piro and Tigua east of the Rio Grande had
    been permanently abandoned on their account. I find no evidence that
    any Jumano inhabited that part of New Mexico at this time, however,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
    nor is there any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>indication that they were in New Mexico at the
    outbreak of the Pueblo rebellion of 1680 or that they participated in
    that bloody revolt during the succeeding twelve years.</p>

  <p>During this period the government of New Mexico was administered from
    El Paso, the provincial capital (Santa Fé) having been completely
    abandoned in 1680. On October 20, 1683, more than 200 Jumano visited
    El Paso for the purpose of asking for missionaries, “stating that
    thirty-two tribes were waiting for baptism, because, being on the point
    of fighting a great battle, and anxious because they were few while
    the enemy were more than 30,000 in number, they invoked the aid of the
    holy cross, of which they had heard from their forefathers, and at
    once there descended through the air a cross wrought in red, with a
    pedestal two yards in breadth ... and that when this cross was put on
    their banner, they had conquered their enemies without losing a man,
    and gaining much spoils of war.” Having acknowledged the miracle, they
    came to ask for baptism. Three friars went to them and found “a great
    multitude of Xumanas and Tejas; they decided to return with better
    preparation and a greater number of ministers.... Some friars returned
    with the intention of going among the Xumanas and Tejas, to Caracoles
    river, where it is said that pearls are fished, in order that they
    might ascertain the truth.... The apparition of the cross turned out to
    be uncertain, because it was a ruse devised by an Indian of the Tejas
    in order that the Spaniards might help them to cross the Conchas river
    to their land, which passage the Apaches were trying to prevent; and
    such chimeras are often tried by the Indians, because they know how
    easily the Spaniards can be made to believe them.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

  <p>This statement is generally too indefinite to be of much value beyond
    the fact that the Jumano—or at least some of them—again ventured
    across the plains as far as El Paso, with another miracle to unfold.
    We may not assume from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>the foregoing statement that the Jumano at
    this time were dwelling in the neighborhood of the Conchos-Rio Grande
    junction, where they were first met, as there is definite evidence
    that their old home had become occupied by the Conchos, Julimes, and
    Chocolomos,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who, so far as is known, were unrelated.</p>

  <p>In December, 1683, according to Escalante, “there arrived at El Paso,
    Juan Sabeata,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> an Indian of the Jumano nation, saying that all his
    people wished to be reclaimed to the Faith, and asked for ministers;
    and that not very far from their country were the Tejas, of whom he
    related so many things that he caused it to be believed that that
    province was one of the most advanced, fertile, and rich in this
    America. For which reason Fray Nicholas Lopez, then vice-custodian,
    desirous of propagating the Gospel, determined to go apostolically,
    without escort or defense, to this exploration with Fray Juan de
    Zavaleta and Fray Antonio de Acevedo.” The governor, however, thought
    it unsafe for the fathers to go alone, so he formed an expedition of
    volunteers under command of Juan Domingo (Dominguez) de Mendoza, who
    accompanied the friars to the junction of the Conchos and Rio Grande,
    where the docile Conchos, Julimes, and Chocolomos now resided. Father
    Acevedo remained with them while the expedition set out for the Rio
    Pecos, and after many days “arrived at a rancheria of Indians who then
    were called Hediondos [“Stinkers”]. Among them were some Jumanes; and
    of the latter [tribe] was Juan Sabeata.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The party later returned
    to El Paso.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

  <p>Henceforward historical references to the Jumano are fewer and farther
    between. Bandelier even asserts that they “were lost sight of after the
    great convulsions of 1680 and succeeding years, and their ultimate fate
    is as unknown as their original numbers.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This is largely true, yet
    there are a few allusions to this erratic people, under the name by
    which they were known to the Spaniards, reference to which will prove
    of interest.</p>

  <p>In 1700, according to contemporary documents,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the Jicarilla Apache
    brought word to Taos, the northernmost of the New Mexican pueblos,
    that the French had destroyed a village of the Jumano on the eastern
    plains; and in 1702 a campaign was made by the Spaniards in that
    direction which resulted only in loss of life at the hands of the
    Apache. It would seem from the circumstance of the destruction of the
    Jumano settlement, and from the facts that the Jicarilla Apache at
    this time were at the Quartelejo<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and the French had penetrated as
    far westward as Nebraska or Kansas,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as well as into Texas, that
    the Jumano village was in the north.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> There is distinct evidence,
    however, aside from that already presented, that a part of the tribe
    had been in Texas for several years, since they are mentioned in French
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>documents of this period. Early in January, 1687, for example, La
    Salle heard of the Choumans, or Choumenes as they were called by the
    Teao (Tohaha) Indians among whom he then was, a short distance east
    of the Colorado river of Texas. These people, he was informed, were
    friends of the Spaniards, from whom they got horses; “that most of
    the said nation had flat heads, that they had Indian corn, which gave
    M. de la Salle ground to believe that those people were some of the
    same he had seen upon his first discovery.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Again, in 1691, we
    are informed, a few rancherias of the Jumano were visited by Governor
    Terán de los Rios, Father Massanet, and others, on the Rio Guadalupe of
    Texas.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>The cause of the disruption between the French and the northern Jumano
    in 1700 does not appear, but the breach seems to have been healed
    by 1719, in which year Governor Antonio Valverde y Cossio led an
    expedition northward and northeastward from Santa Fé against the Ute
    and Comanche. On a stream called Rio Napestle (probably the present
    main Arkansas river), the Governor met the Apache of Quartelejo (i. e.
    the Jicarillas), and found men with gunshot wounds “received from the
    French and their allies, the Pananas [Pawnees] and Jumanas.” Here<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
    again we have definite evidence that a branch of the Jumano was still
    in the north during the first quarter of the eighteenth century. It
    should be noted also that the Jumano here mentioned were allies of the
    Pawnee.</p>

  <p>No definite reference to the northern Jumano between 1719 and 1750
    has yet been found. The members of the ill-fated Villazur expedition
    from Santa Fé to the northeastern plains, and probably as far as the
    Missouri river, in 1720, saw nothing of them, so far as the meager
    account of the expedition<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> shows, although other tribes are
    mentioned. </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p>In 1750, however, definite and important testimony was offered by one
    Pedro Latren, a Frenchman at Santa Fé, who spoke of a tribe, evidently
    the Tawehash (Taovayas), called by the French “Panipiques (Panipiquets)
    alias Jumanes.” Latren referred to these Indians as “parciales de
    los Franceses con los Cumanches.” He also called them Piniques and
    said they were four or five days from the French fort “Canes” or
    Arkansas.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Here we have more definite information regarding the
    affiliation of the Jumano than has yet appeared, and accounts to a
    greater or less extent for the persistent references to the existence
    of a Jumano band in the north during a period of many years, as well
    as explains the mention of the Jumano and the Aijaos together in 1650.
    Now, the Paniques, Panipiquets, etc., as they were designated by
    the French, were the Wichita, the tribe which, in the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries, was known to the Spaniards as “Quiviras.” The
    French designation, of course, had allusion to their common practice of
    tattooing the face, and indicates also relationship with the Pawnees;
    that is, they were “pricked, or tattooed, Pawnee,” a designation
    recalling the Jumanos or “Rayados” of Oñate in 1598, and the alliance
    between the Jumano and the Pawnee mentioned by Valverde y Cossio in
    1719. The name Jumano, it will also be seen, was applied to both the
    Wichita and their immediate relatives the Tawehash, or Taguayazes, as
    they were called by the Spaniards, a southern or Texas branch of the
    tribe, long before the Wichita drifted southward from Kansas to the
    vicinity of the mountains in Oklahoma that still bear their name.</p>

  <p>Another important item in the historical testimony dates from 1778, on
    June 15 of which year a <i>junta de guerra</i> was held in Chihuahua,
    at which were present most of the military authorities of the province.
    The report of the <i>junta</i> says: “The Taguayazes [Tawehash] ...
    are known in New Mexico by the name of ‘Jumanes’ also.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
    “Taguayazes”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> were then on upper Red river, hence not far from the
    region of the Wichita mountains, their subsequent and present home.</p>

  <p>A few years later, in 1789, M. Louis Blanc, commandant at Natchitoches,
    Louisiana, wrote General Ugarte urging the opening of trade between New
    Mexico and Louisiana by establishing a presidio among the Jumano;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
    and in 1812, or thereabouts, it was said (probably an inspiration
    due to the exploit of Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike in 1806–7) that the
    Americans had established “gun factories” among the Jumano and Caigues
    (Kiowa), and that muskets and powder from this source were obtained
    for New Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The item is interesting as being probably the
    first reference to the association of the Wichita-Tawehash and Kiowa,
    who from 1866 occupied the same reservation in Indian Territory and
    Oklahoma until a large part was allotted and the remainder sold in 1901.</p>

  <p>Reference has been made to the settlement of the Wichita in the
    country of the Wichita mountains in the present Oklahoma, after having
    occupied the so-called Quivira country of Kansas in the sixteenth
    and seventeenth centuries. Further evidence of the connection of the
    Wichita-Tawehash people with the Jumano is afforded as late as 1844 by
    Josiah Gregg, who was engaged in the Santa Fé trade and was personally
    familiar with the plains and their aboriginal occupants. Gregg says
    that the northern portion of the Wichita mountains was known to Mexican
    ciboleros and comancheros as Sierra Jumanes,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which recalls the name
    still applied to the mesa in the Salinas region of New Mexico. In the
    same connection Gregg makes the interesting statement that the range of
    hills known as the Wichita mountains are also sometimes called Towyash
    by hunters, “perhaps from Toyavist, the Comanche word for mountain.”
    Gregg evidently was unaware that Tawehash, or Towyash as he calls it,
    was the name of a Wichita division, evidently <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>for the reason that by
    his time the entire group had become generally known to the whites
    as Wichita, while at the same time Indians of other branches of the
    Caddoan stock, to which the Wichita belong, designated, as they still
    designate, the entire Wichita group as the Tawehash.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

  <p>The name Jumano, as applied to the tribe, had disappeared by this time,
    so far as the written record goes; but a trace of the name, dating from
    the middle of the century, lingered in the memory of an informant of
    Bandelier about 1890.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Of these people he says: “I have found ...
    a trace dating as late as 1855. They were then living in Texas, not
    far from the Comanches, and the characteristic disfiguration of the
    face through incisions which they afterward painted, was noticed by my
    informant who visited them about thirty-three years ago.” The facial
    decoration was plainly tattoo, and their proximity to the Comanche
    accords with information previously given.</p>

  <hr class="mt2 mb2">

  <p>We may now summarize the testimony as follows:</p>

  <p>In 1535 and again in 1582 the Spaniards found a semi-agricultural tribe
    living in more or less permanent houses, some of them built of grass,
    on the Rio Grande at the junction of the Conchos in Chihuahua and along
    the former stream northward for a number of leagues. They subsisted
    partly by hunting the buffalo, and raised beans, calabashes, and corn.
    At the date last mentioned they were called Jumano, and the Spaniards
    named them also Patarabueyes. A distinguishing feature of the tribe
    was its tattooing, for which reason, when found east of the Rio Grande
    in New Mexico in 1598, they were called “Rayados” by the Spaniards.
    They were erratic in their movements. The Franciscans established a
    mission among them in New Mexico in 1629, but it does not seem to have
    been successful, for the Indians appear to have been here to-day but
    elsewhere tomorrow. In the seventeenth century they were found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>on the
    plains of Texas, and again living on the prairies to the northward,
    evidently in Kansas, the name seemingly being applied to each of two
    divisions of the same tribe or confederacy. Their custom of tattooing,
    the character of their houses, and their semi-agricultural mode of life
    during the century they were first known, suggest relationship, if not
    identification, with the Wichita people. References in unpublished
    Spanish documents of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries indicate
    that the Jumano of the Spaniards of New Mexico were the Tawehash of
    Texas; and it is known that Tawehash, the name of a division of the
    Wichita, was also the term by which other Caddoan tribes knew the
    Wichita tribe proper. There is direct information from the beginning
    of the nineteenth century that the Wichita mountains, which received
    their name because the Wichita tribe dwelt thereabouts, were also
    called “Jumanes mountains” and “Tawehash mountains,” thus further
    substantiating the testimony that the Jumano and the Tawehash were
    one people. The Tawehash have been absorbed by the Wichita proper,
    and their divisional name is now practically lost. Likewise the
    term Jumano, which, originating in Chihuahua and New Mexico, passed
    into Texas, but seems to have been gradually replaced by the name
    “Tawehash,” which in turn was superseded by “Wichita.”</p>

  <p>Thus is accounted for the disappearance of a tribe that has long been
    an enigma to ethnologists and historians.</p>

      respectively. Indeed, it seems practically certain that such is the
      case. The Obediencia says: ... “el Pueblo de Cuelóce que llaman de
      los rayados.... Yolhá, Capitan que dicen sér del Pueblo y gente deste
      Pueblo de Cuelóce; Pocastaquí, Capitan del Pueblo de Xenopué; Haye,

        Committee of the Archæological Institute of America</cite>, pp. 37, 85,
      1884. We must assume that the four “pueblos” occupied by the tribe in
      Oñate’s time (1598) had all been abandoned and that the “great pueblo
      of the Xumanos” mentioned by Benavides had been established after the
      Jumano had been induced by Salas to return from the plains. Bandelier
      suggests that the Piro pueblo of Tabirá was probably the village of the
      Jumano, but I find no evidence that the Piro and the Jumano occupied a
      settlement together (Bandelier, <cite>Final Report</cite>, pt., <span class="allsmcap">I</span>,
      pp. 131, 132). Escalante (op. cit., <cite>Land of Sunshine</cite>, March,
      1900, p. 248) states that on account of Apache hostilities the pueblos
      of Chililí, Tafique (Tajique), and Quarac of the Tehua (Tigua) Indians;
      and Abó, Jumancas, and Tabirá of the Tompiros, were abandoned. That
      “Jumancas” and the “Pueblo de los Jumanos” were one and the same there
      appears to be no doubt, consequently if Jumancas and Tabirá had been
      the same village they would hardly have been mentioned as distinct.
      Escalante, who wrote in 1778, gathered his information from the
      official archives at Santa Fé.

      algunos xumanas, que eran de Quarac [Quarrá or Cuaraí] administrados.”
      This would indicate that these Christian Jumano were settled a number
      of miles east of their old villages or rancherias at the Mesa de los
      Jumanos, which is only 10 or 15 miles in a straight course east of the
      ruins of Abó. Vetancurt, however, who wrote in 1692, lost sight of the
      fact that all the pueblos of the Salinas country had been abandoned on
      account of Apache depredations prior to the revolt of 1680, hence there
      is little likelihood that the Jumano neophytes remained.</div>

      not find any substantial evidence that the Julimes and the Jumanos
      were identical, or that the various small tribes mentioned in Spanish
      documents of the period were in any way related to the latter. Of the
      languages of the myriad small tribes mentioned in the annals of Texas,
      practically nothing is known. Fray Nicolas Lopez recorded a vocabulary
      of the Jumano language in 1684, but it has disappeared.

      northeast of Taos, while the main body—those of the Quartelejo—were

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
